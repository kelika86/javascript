// Write a function that takes in a year and returns whether it's a leap year. 
// Determining a leap year is as follows 
// If a year is divisible by 4 it is a leap year unless it's divisible by 100. However, if it's divisible by 400 it is a leap year 


function isLeapYear(year){
// You code here

}

Modulus: Everytime a number is divisible the modulus (remainder) must equal to zero;
